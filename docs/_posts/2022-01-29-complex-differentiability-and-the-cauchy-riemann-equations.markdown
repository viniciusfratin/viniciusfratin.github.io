I find the connection between complex-differentiability and the Cauchy-Riemann equations beautiful, and I would like to share it.

Let's first recall the concept of real-differentiability for a real-valued function. 
Given a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) and a point \(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}\), we say that \(f\) is real-differentiable at \(x_0\) if
the limit
\[ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h} \]
exists.
